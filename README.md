# Purpose of py-odf-report #

The program **py-odf-report** aims to make it easy to output
series of documents made with a template text and a set of data, which
can contain text or images (as references). In year 2017, this is quite
hard to make it directly with LibreOffice : inserting texts from a database
is easy, but image references are not resolved, neither turned into
image insertion.

## Format of templates ##

Files must be of type OpenDocumentText,
i.e. mimetype=application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text

Fields can be specified as `@@field@@` or opendocument user fields

For images, a dummy image must be inserted in the template,
with suitable attributes (width, height, etc.)

## Format of data to merge ##

Files must be in csv format. A proper sniffing is made to allow
for various delimiters.

Fields to contain image file names or image URLs **must** start
with `img_`.

Association between images and document are done in the order of
appearance of image elements in the document, with no concern to the
field name.

## Output of the program ##

the program will write a set of files, with a file name like
`out_xxxx.odt`, xxxx being a four-digit number
